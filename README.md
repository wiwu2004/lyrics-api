🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The API uses JWT tokens for authentication.

📌 Authentication flow:
User registers
User logs in
API returns a JWT token
Token must be sent in requests:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
👤 Roles
ROLE_USER → basic access
ROLE_ADMIN → full access
🔒 Access Rules
Endpoint	Access
/auth/**	Public
/contas/**	USER / ADMIN
DELETE /contas/{id}	ADMIN only
⚙️ Validation and Error Handling
Input validation using @Valid
Global exception handling with @RestControllerAdvice
Standardized API responses
Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 403, 404, etc.)
