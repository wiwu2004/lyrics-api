# 🎵 Lyrics API

A backend API for processing song lyrics, translating verses, and providing **on-demand audio pronunciation** for each original verse. The project is designed as a learning-focused, portfolio-ready application showcasing clean architecture, language processing, and text-to-speech integration.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Split lyrics into individual verses
- ✅ Translate verses between multiple languages (EN, ES, PT)
- ✅ Generate **audio pronunciation for the original verse** using Text-to-Speech
- ✅ Audio generated **on-demand** (no file storage)
- ✅ Clean separation between domain, services, and external clients
- ✅ Reactive-compatible (Spring WebFlux style, even when blocking integration is used)

## 💡 Design Decisions

- 🎧 Audio is generated **lazily** to reduce load and storage
- 🧩 Translation and TTS are kept decoupled
- 🧠 Optimized for language-learning use cases
- 📁 No filesystem usage, fully stateless

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Java 25
- Spring Boot 
- Spring Web MVC / WebFlux style
- Reactor (Mono / Flux)
- Google Translate TTS (unofficial)
- Langbly Translation API
